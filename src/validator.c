/**
 * Implementation of Automaton for studies on Warsaw Univeristy
 *
 * [Proces validator]
 *   The validator is a server accepting, or rejecting, words. A word is accepted if it is accepted by
 *   specified automaton. The program validator begins by reading from the standard input
 *   the description of the automaton and then in an infinite loop waits for the words to verify.
 *
 *   When a word is received he runs the program run which validates the word and vaidator waits
 *   for an another word or response from the program run. Afer receiving a message from one of the
 *   run processes validator forwords the message to the adequate tester.
 *
 *   When a tester send an unique stop word ! the server stops , i.e. he does not accept new words,
 *   collects the responses from the run processes, forwards the answers, writes a report on stdout, and, finally, terminates.
 *
 *   The validator report consist in three lines describing the numbers of received queries, sent answers and accepted words:
 *
 *     Rcd: x\n
 *     Snt: y\n
 *     Acc: z\n
 * 
 * where x,y,z respectively are the numbers of received queries, sent answers and accepted words; and a sequence of summaries of the interactions with the programs tester from which validator received at least one query. A summary for a tester with PID pid consists in:
 *
 *     [PID: pid\n
 *     Rcd: y\n
 *     Acc: z\n]
 *
 * where pid,y,z respectively are: the process' pid, the number of messages received from this process and the number of acceped words sent by this process.
