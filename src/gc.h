/** @file

*  GC interface without implementation.

*  Define ENABLE_GC macro to use GC
*  You must also call GC_SETUP() macro at the very begging of the function main.
*  (in the first line probably)
*
*  This file provides basic GC utilities without any detailed implementation to allow
*  inclusion of any matching interface collector.
*
*  If ENABLE_GC macro was not defined then the GC will fallback in not-supported mode.
*  In not-supported mode all macros and functions needed by them will be present but
*  will perform no action when it's not declared otherwise.
